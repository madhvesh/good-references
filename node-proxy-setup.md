# Configuring NPM, Node and Bower behind a proxy on windows

This page provides the basic tools and configuration for bootstraping an application with npm and bower behind a proxy on windows. There is still a lot of struggle with setting up your workstation behind a proxy on windows, I am creating this hoping to make it easy for developers to get started scaffolding their apps behind the proxy. It also serves as a cheat sheet for some of the npm packages that can be used to build a responsive application.
